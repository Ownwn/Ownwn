I'm a third-year student interested in FOSS, cybersecurity and general tech.

I'm skilled in Java, Kotlin and Javascript, and am currently learning OCaml. Some of my projects include:

- [Personal Site](https://github.com/Ownwn/PersonalSite)
  A custom LLM interface that supports the latest SOTA models through their respective APIs. I've been using this project for almost 2 years consistently; it's definitely my best work due to how useful it's been


- [Owen's Mod](https://github.com/Ownwn/OwnwnAddons)   a Minecraft mod that adds a collection of quality-of-life features to the game, designed for a niche gamemode.

As of January 2026, I'm currently on exchange at the National University of Singapore, where I'm taking 5 CS classes. 

I love keeping up to date with the latest trends and developments in software and the web.
