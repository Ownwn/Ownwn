# Owen

I'm a second-year student interested in FOSS, cybersecurity and general tech.

I'm skilled in Java, Kotlin and Javascript, and am currently learning Typescript and C++. I've recently learnt React, and have rewritten [Personal Site](https://github.com/Ownwn/PersonalSite) in it.

My other projects include:
- [Class Question App](https://github.com/Ownwn/class-question-app) - a WIP recreation of GoSoapBox, a now shut-down Q&A tool for student engagement and learning.
- [Owen's Mod](https://github.com/Ownwn/OwnwnAddons) - a Minecraft mod that adds a collection of quality-of-life features to the game, designed for a niche gamemode.
- [DiaryParser](https://github.com/Ownwn/DiaryParser) - A parser and data visualiser for my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) daily notes.

I recently finished a hackathon, where our team developed [Locked In](https://github.com/LOCKED-IN-HACKATHON/Backend) - A competitive study app that gamifies learning and encourages students to compete with each other.

I love keeping up to date with the latest trends and developments in software and the web.
